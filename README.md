**Objective:**  
To analyze product sales performance using SQL for data preprocessing and Power BI for interactive visualization.

**Steps Taken:**

## Data Cleaning & Transformation (SQL):
- Connected SQL Server to Power BI.
- Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using SQL queries (`JOINS`, `GROUP BY`, `CASE` statements, etc.).
- Created views to filter only relevant KPIs for dashboard use.

## Data Modeling & DAX in Power BI:
- Defined relationships between tables (Date, Product, Customer, Sales).
- Created DAX measures to calculate:
  - Total Revenue, Quantity Sold, Profit Margin
  - Monthly sales trends
  - Top-performing products and regions

## Dashboard Components:
- **Slicers**: Filtered by Region, Month, Product Category
- **KPI Cards**: Displayed total revenue, profit, and total units sold
- **Line Chart**: Showed monthly revenue trends
- **Bar Chart**: Product-wise sales comparison
- **Map Visual**: Regional sales performance

## Insights Discovered:
- Region X had the highest sales and profit margins.
- Product Category Y underperformed consistently.
- Seasonal peaks identified during Q2 and Q4.

## Design & Branding:
- Clean dark/light theme with company logo
- Responsive layout with bookmarks for different views
